triple quoted strings
-use it when you statement spans multiple lines
-use if you values alrady has single or double quoted strings

object oriented or dynamic typing
all codes executed are object, and based on object types, python performs its work
dynamic typing is where you update the values/content of the object. in case of value update, the previous value will be in garbage
collector which will be emptied during runtime. this frees up the memory

like curly brackets in R, for python its indentation.so, if you are putting random indentation, its like adding random brackets.


Sentinal control iteration: 
 what if you dont know how many data exists? in that case you apply loop for a condidtion that does not exists. and unless all data is read, the condition won't satisfy. this will let you fetch all data. 

from decimal import Decimal: 
this is required for high degree of precision. it stores vlaues in the formats of strings and not in binary, makes it precise. i might use it if i work on rockets though

break and continue statements


and or not operators
statistics module
creating functions in python 
"H" if random.randrange(2) == 0 else "T" : its a good way of using elseif statement
local scope and global scope
importing modules and functoins, giving short names to module importing, and shortcoming of wildcat import(eg: from math import * ) this import all 
object ID in python
function style programming:declarative programming: pure functions 


list comprehension 
list4 = [item for item in range(1,6) if item % 2 == 0]

generator expression 
for i in (x**3 for x in li if x % 2 == 0):
   ...:     print(i)  ##see the parenthesis instead of big brackets. this defines generator expression.
